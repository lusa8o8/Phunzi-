To keep this as minimal as possible, we should focus on a **"Feeds-based"** architecture. Think of it like a simplified version of Patreon or OnlyFans, but strictly for academic course updates.

Here is the blueprint for a **Minimal Viable Product (MVP)**.

---

### 1. The Three-Screen Architecture

You only need three main views to solve this problem effectively.

#### **A. The Course Discovery (Home)**

* **Search Bar:** Search by Course Code (e.g., MATH 1110).
* **Course Cards:** Showing the course name, the "Official Note-Taker" rating, and the monthly subscription price ($5–$10).
* **Status Badge:** A green "Live" dot if a lecture is currently happening.

#### **B. The Course Feed (The "Premium" View)**

Once you pay, you unlock this feed. It looks like a clean timeline:

* **Top Section:** "Next Assignment Due: Friday 14th" (Pinned by the Note-Taker).
* **The Timeline:** * *Entry 1:* [PDF Icon] Lecture Notes - Set Theory (March 5).
* *Entry 2:* [Audio Icon] 30-second explanation of the "Limit" concept.
* *Entry 3:* [Text] "Lecturer says the tutorial on Monday is cancelled."



#### **C. The Upload Dashboard (For the Note-Taker)**

A simple "Plus" (+) button for the student to:

* Upload PDF (Scan).
* Post a "Quick Update" (Text).
* Post an "Urgent Alert" (Triggers a notification for subscribers).

### 2. The Functional Flow (How it works)

1. **Validation:** The Note-Taker uploads a photo of their UNZA ID and their MATH 1110 registration.
2. **Subscription:** You hit "Subscribe," pay via Mobile Money (Airtel/MTN) or Card.
3. **Delivery:** The moment the student finishes the lecture and hits "Upload," you get a push notification: *"MATH 1110: Today's notes are ready."*
4. **Rating:** At the end of the week, you give a 1–5 star rating. If the rating drops too low, the Note-Taker is replaced.

### 3. Minimal Tech Stack (How to build it fast)

Since you are a student, don't build this from scratch with code. Use **No-Code tools**:

* **Frontend:** [Glide Apps](https://www.glideapps.com/). It allows you to turn a Google Sheet into a professional-looking app in hours.
* **Database:** **Google Sheets**. Each row is a new lecture update.
* **Payments:** **Flutterwave** or **Paystack**. Both work in Zambia and handle Mobile Money, which is essential for UNZA students.
* **Storage:** **Cloudinary** or **Google Drive API** (to host the PDF notes).

### 4. The "Anti-Ghosting" Feature (Crucial)

The biggest risk is the 1st-year student getting lazy. The app should have a **"Proof of Presence"** timer:

* The Note-Taker must "Check-in" via GPS at the UNZA Lecture Theatre during the scheduled class time.
* If they don't check in, the app sends them a warning. If they don't upload by 6:00 PM, their payout for that day is docked.

### 5. Monetization Logic

* **User pays:** $10.00
* **Platform fee (You):** $2.00 (to cover hosting/maintenance).
* **Note-Taker earns:** $8.00
* *Scale:* If 10 people subscribe to that one student, the student earns **$80/month** (approx. K2,000)—which is huge for a 1st year—and you earn **$20/month** passive income.

### Next Step

Since you’re in your final year and likely busy, would you like me to **outline the specific "Data Columns" you would need in a Google Sheet** to start building this in Glide Apps right now?
