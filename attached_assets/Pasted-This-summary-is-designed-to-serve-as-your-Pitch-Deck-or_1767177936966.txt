### **Project Summary: ClassSync (The "Service-Course" Lifeline)**

#### **The Problem: The "Final-Year Bottleneck"**

At the University of Zambia (UNZA), final-year students often face "course overload," requiring them to repeat foundational courses while managing senior-level credits. **MATH 1110** (School of Humanities) represents a specific crisis:

* **Physical Barriers:** Massive enrollment leads to overcrowded lecture halls, making physical attendance difficult and unproductive.
* **Scheduling Conflicts:** Final-year timetables often clash with 1st-year service courses.
* **Content Complexity:** MATH 1110 is notoriously difficult, requiring consistent updates and expert-level note-taking that standard "group chats" fail to provide.
* **Information Gap:** Currently, there is no formal, paid marketplace that connects "time-poor" seniors with "high-performing" juniors.

#### **The Solution: A Micro-Subscription Marketplace**

**ClassSync** is a minimal, mobile-first platform that allows busy students to "outsource" their classroom presence to verified, high-performing students already in the room. It transforms note-taking from a casual favor into a professional, paid service.

#### **Core Value Proposition**

* **For the Subscriber (Final Year):** For a small monthly fee ($5–$10), they receive a guaranteed stream of high-quality PDFs, audio summaries, and administrative alerts (quizzes/deadlines) without needing to fight for a seat in a packed hall.
* **For the Provider (1st Year):** They monetize their existing academic diligence. By simply uploading the notes they are already taking, they earn a steady monthly income (via Mobile Money).

#### **How the App Works (The MVP)**

1. **Verified Sourcing:** Note-takers must upload proof of registration and maintain a high user rating to stay on the platform.
2. **The "Live Feed":** Instead of messy chat threads, users see a structured "Lecture Timeline" where each entry is a dated PDF scan or a voice note.
3. **Proof of Delivery:** The app uses timestamped uploads and "check-ins" to ensure the note-taker was actually present, protecting the subscriber's investment.
4. **Integrated Payments:** Built-in support for Airtel and MTN Mobile Money ensures the transaction is seamless and secure.

#### **The Impact**

ClassSync doesn't just share notes; it provides **academic insurance**. It ensures that a student’s graduation isn't delayed by a 1st-year repeat course, while simultaneously providing financial support to hardworking junior students.
